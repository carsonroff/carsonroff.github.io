      <h3>Internship Overview</h3>
      <p>I had the privilege to intern at Schilling Robotics during the summer of 2022. Schilling Robotics is a leading company in the field, specializing in robotic solutions for subsea exploration and intervention.</p>
      <h3>Contributions and Achievements</h3>
      <p>During my internship, I collaborated with assembly technicians and design engineers to develop work instructions for the Gemini Tool Carousel Assembly. I was responsible for the design and assembly of a nitrogen test fixture for fluid paths in the azimuth joint of the ~$300k Gemini Manipulator. Additionally, I researched and developed test criteria for the azimuth test fixture and participated in Kaizen events to reduce cycle time, improve safety, and enhance quality on high-volume assemblies.</p>
      <p>I also designed, manufactured, and implemented assembly fixtures to improve ergonomics, reduce cycle time, and enhance safety. My contributions extended to updating designs, processes, and cell instructions based on valuable technician feedback.</p>
      <p>Throughout my time at Schilling Robotics, I received recognition for my strong work ethic, hands-on skills, and effective presentation abilities. I formed valuable connections with engineers, managers, technicians, and fellow interns, enhancing my understanding of engineering practices and fostering collaborative teamwork.</p>
