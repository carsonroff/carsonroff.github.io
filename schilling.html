          <p>I had the privilege to intern at Schilling Robotics during the summer of 2022. Schilling Robotics is a leading company in the field, specializing in robotic solutions for subsea exploration and intervention.</p>
          <p>During my internship, I was involved in various projects, contributing to design, assembly, and testing. I was recognized for my presentation skills, hands-on expertise, and strong work ethic.</p>
          <p>I developed valuable connections with engineers, managers, technicians, and fellow interns, which enriched my understanding of engineering practices and teamwork.</p>
